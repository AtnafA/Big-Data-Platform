The data portal is developed to overlay, share and manage the project's data that were collected from different geographic locations of Ethiopia. The platform is vital to manage large sized, heterogeneous data and its transactions. Also it implemented a cross-platform authentication scheme known as Unified Identity Authentication Service (UIAS). UIAS is the Security in Depth (SiD) mechanism that provides multilayered security measurements such as an implementation of Transport Layer Security (TLS) over HTTP protocol for web requests and creates a web-form with “POST” method. It also configures SSL over LDAP server for identity validation and implements access privileges for data mapping and object binding. As shown in figure below, the enterprise system has different components and is designed into three distinct layers such as presentation, service and data access layer.

**SAMPLE OUTPUT OF THE FRAMEWORK (Data Portal Output):**<br />
Data Upload Module is used to upload large sized and broadly classfied big data all in one in a unit interface:
The user (Biniyam Zeray) uploads different types of large sized data such as ninety-two (92) vector data (shape files), forty-nine (49) raster data, two (2) point cloud data, one (1) drawing files, one (1) total station data, one (1) time series data, and one (1) other data. Simultaneously, he also annotated meta data such as defining the project name, selecting project’s thematic area, selecting classification of data under the thematic area, outlining file types via checking the check list, and selecting region and basin

Data Access Module is used to Overview meta data of Big data as well as used to dowload dataset:
The user (Atnaf Aberaham) searches meta data of the dataset by using the project names keyword. The system displays meta data in a simultaneous fashion, which loads the project name on the left side of the main window. When the user clicks on the selected project name <WS18 ---- TOP_5_2012>, the project thematic area <Geodetic> is displayed in the top right part of the main window. Then, the user views the project’s meta data in the right-center part of the main window by clicking on <Geodetic>. This tests the interfaces multi-tasking functionablity; therefore, the user can perform the concurrent operation.
