Data Upload Module is used to upload large sized and broadly classfied big data all in one in a unit interface:
The user (Biniyam Zeray) uploads different types of large sized data such as ninety-two (92) vector data (shape files), forty-nine (49) raster data, two (2) point cloud data, one (1) drawing files, one (1) total station data, one (1) time series data, and one (1) other data. Simultaneously, he also annotated meta data such as defining the project name, selecting project’s thematic area, selecting classification of data under the thematic area, outlining file types via checking the check list, and selecting region and basin

Data Access Module is used to Overview meta data of Big data as well as used to dowload dataset:
The user (Atnaf Aberaham) searches meta data of the dataset by using the project names keyword. The system displays meta data in a simultaneous fashion, which loads the project name on the left side of the main window. When the user clicks on the selected project name <WS18 ---- TOP_5_2012>, the project thematic area <Geodetic> is displayed in the top right part of the main window. Then, the user views the project’s meta data in the right-center part of the main window by clicking on <Geodetic>. This tests the interfaces multi-tasking functionablity; therefore, the user can perform the concurrent operation.
